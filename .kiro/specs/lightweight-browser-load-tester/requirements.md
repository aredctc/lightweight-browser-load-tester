# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a lightweight load testing tool that uses real browsers to test streaming applications, specifically focusing on DRM license acquisition. The tool must be resource-efficient, use only open source technologies, and allow parameterization of API calls during page interactions. The primary use case is load testing streaming applications by creating a minimal page containing only the streaming functionality to minimize computational overhead.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want to perform load testing using real browsers, so that I can simulate authentic user behavior for streaming applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the load testing tool is initiated THEN the system SHALL launch real browser instances using open source browser automation tools
2. WHEN browser instances are created THEN the system SHALL minimize resource consumption by using headless browser mode by default
3. WHEN multiple browser instances are running THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage memory and CPU usage to support concurrent sessions
4. IF browser automation is required THEN the system SHALL use only open source tools like Playwright or Selenium

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a performance tester, I want to parameterize API requests that occur during page interactions, so that I can test different scenarios and data combinations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made during page interactions THEN the system SHALL intercept and modify request parameters
2. WHEN request parameters are configured THEN the system SHALL support dynamic parameter injection including headers, query parameters, and request bodies
3. WHEN multiple test scenarios are defined THEN the system SHALL support parameter templates and variable substitution
4. IF API interception is needed THEN the system SHALL capture and modify network requests without breaking the application flow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a streaming application tester, I want to specifically test DRM license acquisition, so that I can validate the licensing system under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming content is accessed THEN the system SHALL monitor and capture DRM license requests
2. WHEN DRM license calls are made THEN the system SHALL measure response times and success rates
3. WHEN license acquisition fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for analysis
4. IF DRM testing is performed THEN the system SHALL support common DRM systems like Widevine, PlayReady, and FairPlay

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the tool to be as lightweight as possible, so that I can run high-concurrency tests without excessive resource consumption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is running THEN the system SHALL minimize memory footprint per browser instance
2. WHEN concurrent users are simulated THEN the system SHALL optimize resource sharing between browser instances
3. WHEN load testing is performed THEN the system SHALL provide configurable limits for CPU and memory usage
4. IF resource optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL support browser instance pooling and reuse

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create minimal streaming pages for testing, so that I can reduce computational overhead during load testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test pages are created THEN the system SHALL support loading minimal HTML pages containing only streaming functionality
2. WHEN streaming pages are loaded THEN the system SHALL exclude unnecessary UI elements, analytics, and third-party scripts
3. WHEN page optimization is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain core streaming functionality while removing non-essential features
4. IF custom pages are needed THEN the system SHALL provide templates for creating lightweight streaming test pages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want to configure and monitor load testing scenarios, so that I can control test execution and analyze results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN load tests are configured THEN the system SHALL support defining concurrent user counts, test duration, and ramp-up patterns
2. WHEN tests are running THEN the system SHALL provide real-time monitoring of active sessions, success rates, and performance metrics
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports including response times, error rates, and resource utilization
4. IF test configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL support configuration files and command-line parameters for test scenarios

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the tool to use only open source components, so that I can deploy it without licensing restrictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is built THEN the system SHALL use only open source browser automation frameworks
2. WHEN dependencies are included THEN the system SHALL ensure all components have permissive open source licenses
3. WHEN deployment is needed THEN the system SHALL not require any proprietary software or licenses
4. IF third-party tools are integrated THEN the system SHALL verify their open source compliance before inclusion
